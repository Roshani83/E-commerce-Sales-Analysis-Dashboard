#Conclusion
Sales are concentrated in a few states and customers, with a heavy reliance on certain categories and payment modes. Printers and Bookcases are key profit drivers, but mid-year losses indicate seasonal or operational challenges. Focus on sustaining profitable product lines, improving underperforming months, and expanding sales in low-performing states could enhance revenue stability.
